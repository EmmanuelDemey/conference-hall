## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The master branch is where incoming new features are merged (the next coming release).
- The production branch is a snapshot of the latest stable release.
- All hotfix should be done in dedicated branch from the `production` branch.
- All new features / bugs should be done in dedicated branch from the `master` branch.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.
